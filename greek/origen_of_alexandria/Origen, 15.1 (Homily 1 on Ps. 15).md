# Origen, 15.1 (Homily 1 on Ps. 15)

*Homily 1 on the 15th Psalm.*

## 1
Some letters are inscribed on steles of the soul, “not with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God” and are written not in steles[^1] made of stone nor in hearts that are stone-like, hard, and unyielding to God’s words, like that of Pharaoh, who had hardened his heart. These words here are written for a heart that is soft and yielding to the Spirit who inscribes them, a heart that is said for this reason to be “fleshly.”[^2] Because these letters are holy and inscribed in a “stele of flesh”, they cause the psalm to have the inscription, “an  inscription on a stele.”  This is why the psalm that has been read aloud has the introduction, “an inscription on a stele, for David.”    

Now if you wish to know the psalms that have an introduction[^3] mentioning a stele inscription (even if they have other content) take note that these are the 55th, 56th, the one after it, the 58th and the 59th. Our psalm here says, “an inscription on a stele, for David.”  By contrast, each of those has other additions; for example, the 55th psalm reads, “Regarding completion, for the sake of the people that was far off from the holy places; pertaining to David; for inscription on a stele; when foreigners seized him in Geth.”[^4] The 56th has,  “regarding completion; do not destroy! Pertaining to David; for inscription on a stele; when he was running away from the face of Saul into a cave.” But so that I do not go on saying what you yourselves can find and read, we note that the rest have “inscription on a stele” with other content appended to the mention of a stele inscription. Only this one has nothing in the psalm’s introduction except the mention of “inscription on a stele.” 

[^1]:	Perrone writes, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶ λιθίναις [στήλαις] (suppressing στήλαις, steles,  in favor of πλαξί, tablets). It seems to me slightly more likely that πλαξί has intruded inappropriately from 2 Cor 3:3 (which Origen has just cited) and should be suppressed instead (I’d print: οὐκ ἐν [πλαξὶ] λιθίναις στήλαις).  

[^2]:	Perrone conjectures καὶ μ\<έντοι\> διὰ τοῦτο σαρκίνην (the bits after καὶ are unclear in the text. I suggest instead that the scribe (and Origen) wrote instead καὶ λεγομένην διὰ τοῦτο σαρκινήν, and have translated so above.

[^3]:	The traditional term in English for the small introductions to the Psalms is “inscription” (In Greek, ἐπιγραφή). Unhelpfully we have overlap in English between literary unit (psalm introduction as “inscription”) . I have opted here instead to translate with the more general term “introduction” to decrease ambiguity.   

[^4]:	The inscriptions of the Psalms are notoriously tricky to interpret. I have followed a few suggestions from Albert Piertsma’s translation of the Greek Psalms in [](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/24-ps-nets.pdf "the New English Translation of the Septuagint.")
