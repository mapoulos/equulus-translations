# Origen, 15.1 (Homily 1 on Ps. 15)

*Homily 1 on the 15th Psalm.*

## 1

Some letters are inscribed on steles of the soul, “not with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God” and are written not in steles[^1] made of stone nor in hearts that are stone-like, hard, and unyielding to God’s words, like that of Pharaoh, who had hardened his heart. These words here are written for a heart that is soft and yielding to the Spirit who inscribes them, a heart that is said for this reason to be “fleshly.”[^2] Because these letters are holy and inscribed in a “stele of flesh”, they cause the psalm to have the inscription, “an  inscription on a stele.”  This is why the psalm that has been read aloud has the introduction, “an inscription on a stele, for David.”    

Now if you wish to know the psalms that have an introduction[^3] mentioning a stele inscription (even if they have other content) take note that these are the 55th, 56th, the one after it, the 58th and the 59th. Our psalm here says, “an inscription on a stele, for David.”  By contrast, each of those has other additions; for example, the 55th psalm reads, “Regarding completion, for the sake of the people that was far off from the holy places; pertaining to David; for inscription on a stele; when foreigners seized him in Geth.”[^4] The 56th has,  “regarding completion; do not destroy! Pertaining to David; for inscription on a stele; when he was running away from the face of Saul into a cave.” But so that I do not go on saying what you yourselves can find and read, we note that the rest have “inscription on a stele” with other content appended to the mention of a stele inscription. Only this one has nothing in the psalm’s introduction except the mention of “inscription on a stele.” 

“You shall not make for yourself a stele [with those things] which the Lord despises.”[^5] Once you understand what’s been said, you’ll see that the one who wrote the introductions for the psalms did break the law when writing “for a stele inscription”.   Pay close attention to the Law’s wording, which says, “You shall not make for yourself a stele, [with those things] that the Lord despises.” If the passage was meant to be understood in a more simple way, it would say, “you shall not make for yourself a stele, for the Lord despises steles” or “you shall not make for yourself a stele, which the Lord despises.”  Here, however, it begins in the singular, but then continues in the plural: “you shall not make for yourself a stele, [with the things] that the Lord despises.” 

Now I consider this command to be of this sort– every person, regardless of what they are doing, is fashioning for themselves a stele. If they are not living rightly, then they are fashioning for themselves “a stele, with the things that the Lord despises,” since in their stele there is sin and the works of the flesh, like sexual immorality, impurity, indulgence, idolatry, and the rest. But if someone is living rightly, they are not acting against the law as they fashion their stele, since they are making a stele with the things that the Lord loves. The letters on the stele are one part of themselves,[^6] where what the Lord loves is written, and their life is another part of their stele, which the Lord loves. The command is not that one should avoid fashioning a stele altogether, for then David would be acting unlawfully in writing “for inscription on a stele.” Rather, we must avoid fashioning a stele with the things that the Lord despises. 

Likewise, Isaac honored Rachel with a stele on her departure from this life: “This stele at the tomb of Rachel persists to the present day.” (Gn 35:30)  He was certainly not acting contrary to the law in any fashion. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were taught to live by it, as the apostle says, by nature.[^7] It’s said in the apostle’s writing this way: “for when the nations that do not have a law do by nature carry out the dictations…” So guided by nature Abraham carried out the dictates of the law. Before God’s law was written down with ink, it had already been inscribed onto his heart. This is why he was found righteous as having carried out all the “dictates, judgments, and regulations of God,” as it is written in Genesis. Similarly, Jacob did not act contrary to the law in making a stele for the tomb of Rachel so that Rachel’s virtues would be on display for those who could see it.  This is enough for the present on the introduction.

Let us look now at the psalm and note first that the speaker in the psalm is our Lord Jesus Christ.  In some psalms, when we say that the character is speaking in advance for our Lord, we could be wrong or right, in that we may be contriving a solution, responding to intuition or illumination, or merely guessing.  In other psalms, we learn the identity of the speaker from the scriptures, as is the case here. In the Acts of the Apostles, it is written that the passage, “you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will you allow your holy one to see decay,” which occurs in this psalm, is spoken by the savior. Along with the other eleven apostles Peter understands these words this way:

> For David speaks of him,  
> ‘I beheld the Lord before me continually  
> for he is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.  
> For this reason my heart rejoices and my tongue is glad.  
> Even my flesh shall dwell in hope  
> because you will not abandon my soul to Hades  
> nor allow your holy one to see decay.  
> You have made known to me the ways of life.  
> Before your face, you will fill me with gladness.’   
> My brothers, with certainty I may speak to you of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried and that his tomb is among us to this very day. Yet being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne, he spoke with prophetic vision of the resurrection  of the Christ, that he would not be abandoned to Hades nor would his flesh see decay.” 

Clearly he says here that Jesus did not see decay and that his soul was not forsaken to Hades, though he did descend because of God’s plan, since all realms needed the presence of Christ Jesus, even those under the earth. And he went down from the place under the earth into Hades itself. For the one who ascended is the same who descended, so that he may fill all things. (Eph 4:10) Peter’s other citations in the Acts of the Apostles will make it still more clear that this psalm is spoken by our savior, Jesus Christ.

“Protect me Lord, because I have placed my hope on you. I said to the Lord…” The savior is narrating to us his own prayer so that in narrating it he would also teach us to pray. He would pray to the Father saying, “protect me Lord,” since the savior is dependent on the Father and since God alone is entirely self-sufficient and without need of anything. Yet the savior, even if he is dependent, has an advantage, as he is dependent only upon the God of all. Moses, by comparison, when he is dependent, is dependent upon God, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, and the angels that stand by him and help. The more lowly we are, the more we are dependent on other beings, since nothing receives its help only from God.  Now if I say that the savior is dependent and Christ is Wisdom, do not take offense at what I’ve said. I am not saying that he is dependent in precisely the same way that you or another of those who need the help of those who serve under God.[^8] Rather, I am saying that he is dependent upon the one God and Father, to whom he would pray through the prophets just as he does here. So too, in the gospels he would withdraw to lonely places and pray to God, as he was dependent upon him. 

Now, should I ever desire to carry out my prayer just like the savior, like one who is dependent only upon God, and I offer my prayer without the savior, I am praying an imperfect prayer. Even if my prayer is being sent up to God, it must be sent up through Jesus Christ, who is the high-priest and guardian of our souls. After all, the Father does not receive the prayer if I offer it without availing myself of the high-priest, since it cannot reach him without Jesus Christ offering it to him. To Jesus, God spoke with an oath: “you are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” (Ps 109; Heb 5:6)  And even if our Lord needs the protection that comes from the Father, in saying “protect me Lord, for I have placed my hope on you” he is also narrating his prayer to us and saying that he has said this to the Lord himself. So he himself needs protection and would suffer who knows what without the protection of the Father. 

I can also explain this is in a way that many will found more pleasing and auspicious. How does the savior say, “protect me, Lord, for I have placed my hope on you?” I say that he says this to his Lord and father about those who are his own body parts. I’d say moreover that just as someone who prays for their own body is not praying about someone else but about themselves (for example, if I am praying about my head, I am praying about myself), similarly if I am praying for the parts of my body I am praying about myself, and this is how you should understand the savior’s words in prayer when he says, “protect me, Lord,” since “you are each the body parts of Christ” and “you are the body of Christ.”  In speaking for himself he is praying for you, for you are his body, his body part, unless you want to be separated from him. The savior is a composite being[^9] precisely for your sake. You are a composite being because you have a body inferior to the being of your soul and the nature of your spirit.    My savior and lord, by contrast, is a composite being because of the church, which is his body, and it was for her protection that he prays, saying, “protect me, Lord!” By the same logic he says refers to his body when saying all of this: “I was hungry and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me drink.” It’s as if I said, “If you gave food to my body, you gave it to me. If you provided drink for my body, you provided it for me.”   
Therefore, whatever we do for Christ’s body, the church, and for Christ’s body parts, our brothers and sisters, we do for Christ. After all, if we treat poorly someone who places their trust in Christ, we are treating Christ with spite, speaking ill of Christ, or neglecting Christ. If we treat them with dignity, we are treating Christ well, if we feed the one who is hungry and give drink to the one who is thirsty. Don’t then think that the stakes are merely about a person when you treat your neighbor either fairly or poorly. The stakes are over Christ himself.  Eli states in First Samuel, “if a man sins against another man, they shall pray for him. Yet if he sins against the Lord, who shall pray for him?” Do not think that you are sinning against a person, when you sin against a Christian. When you sin against a Christian, you sin against Christ. When you sin against a non-believer, you are sinning against a person.  

[^1]:	Perrone writes, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶ λιθίναις [στήλαις] (suppressing στήλαις, steles,  in favor of πλαξί, tablets). It seems to me slightly more likely that πλαξί has intruded inappropriately from 2 Cor 3:3 (which Origen has just cited) and should be suppressed instead (I’d print: οὐκ ἐν [πλαξὶ] λιθίναις στήλαις).  

[^2]:	Perrone conjectures καὶ μ\<έντοι\> διὰ τοῦτο σαρκίνην (the bits after καὶ are unclear in the text. I suggest instead that the scribe (and Origen) wrote instead καὶ λεγομένην διὰ τοῦτο σαρκινήν, and have translated so above.

[^3]:	The traditional term in English for the small introductions to the Psalms is “inscription” (In Greek, ἐπιγραφή). Unhelpfully we have overlap in English between literary unit (psalm introduction as “inscription”) . I have opted here instead to translate with the more general term “introduction” to decrease ambiguity.   

[^4]:	The inscriptions of the Psalms are notoriously tricky to interpret. I have followed a few suggestions from Albert Piertsma’s translation of the Greek Psalms in [](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/24-ps-nets.pdf "the New English Translation of the Septuagint.")

[^5]:	The ambiguity of the passage from Greek Deuteronomy is difficult to bring out in English. I have supplied in brackets English words which are consistent with how Origen interprets the package but are only latent in the Greek. Origen’s bible reads, οὐ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ στήλην, ἃ ἐμίσησε κύριος.  Origen here carefully notes the discrepancy between στήλην (a feminine singular noun) and the connecting relative pronoun ἅ (a neuter plural). He thus interprets the antecedent of the relative pronoun not as στήλην (if this were the case we’d expect ἥν) but supplies something like τούτοις or αὐτοῖς. 

[^6]:	I have followed the manuscript in punctuation  after καὶ αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ τῆς στήλης and taken ἑαυτοῦ as subordinate μέρος.  

[^7]:	\<TE\> I place a full-stop after παρὰ τῷ ἀποστόλῳ αὐτὸν φύσει, instead of a comma.

[^8]:	That is, ‘people’ who need the help of the angles that serve at God’s command. 

[^9]:	That is, the
